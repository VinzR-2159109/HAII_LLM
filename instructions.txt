1. Lay the t-shirt flat on a surface.
2. Start by folding the shirt in half lengthwise.
3. Next, fold the shirt in half again, creating a smaller square shape.
4. Finally, fold the folded edges of the shirt inward to create smaller folds, resulting in a neatly folded package.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 with any additional shirts.
6. If you need to unfold a shirt, gently pull at one corner until it opens up completely.
7. To store or transport the folded shirts, stack them neatly on top of each other.
8. Ensure that all folds are even and tight for best results.
