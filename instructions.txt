1. Lay the t-shirt flat on a surface.
2. Fold the shirt in half along its length axis.
3. Fold the folded section in half again, creating smaller sections.
4. Carefully align and fold each small section in half, maintaining the shape.
5. Continue folding the smallest sections until you reach the desired size or structure.
6. Ensure that all folds are neat and align well with the previous folds.
7. For a blue cloth item, follow the same steps as for a t-shirt, ensuring the material is treated gently to preserve its texture.
8. To create a small, compact display of folded clothes, start by folding each garment as described above, then arrange them upright in a row or column.
